If the target was a large or double-strength creature, the replacement must be large or double-strength, or perhaps two normal undead instead of one show up. Ditto for huge/triple-strength targets. Therefore you’re only slightly reducing the raw power of the opposition; the advantage of using the spell is that you’re getting rid of an enemy you match up badly against and dropping the level of the opposition by one. The disadvantage, of course, is that you’ll probably have to face that enemy again.",
